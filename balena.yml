  ## Usage instructions

  Add a new tag key `backup_id` in the Dashboard in order to enable backups for
  a specific device.

  The tag value will be used as the backup name and should be unique.

  The runner will find online devices with that tag and rsync the data volumes
  to a local volume.

  Note that a new SSH key will be added to your dashboard as part of the
  authentication process.
