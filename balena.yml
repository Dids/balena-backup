description: A non-interactive backup utility for balenaCloud managed devices.
version: 1.0.0
post-provisioning: >-
  ## Usage instructions

  Add a new tag key `backup_id` in the Dashboard in order to enable backups for
  a specific device.

  The tag value will be used as the backup name and should be unique.

  The app will find online devices with that tag and cache the data volumes to a
  local directory or disk.

  Note that a new SSH key will be added to your dashboard as part of the
  authentication process.

  The app will encrypt and upload snapshots of each cache directory to the cloud
  backend of your choosing.
